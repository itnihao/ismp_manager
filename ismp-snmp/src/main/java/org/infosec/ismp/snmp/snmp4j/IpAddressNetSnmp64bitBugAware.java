/**
 * @author Jeff Gehlbach <jeffg@opennms.org>
 * 
 * This class exists solely to work around a bug in the Net-SNMP BER library
 * that causes Net-SNMP agents prior to version 5.4.1 on 64-bit platforms to
 * encode IPv4 addresses as 8 bytes rather than 4 bytes.  SNMP4J correctly
 * discards these representations by default.
 * 
 *  This class will be used in place of org.snmp4j.smi.IpAddress only if we
 *  call org.snmp4j.SNMP4JSettings.setExtensibilityEnabled(true) AND set the
 *  system property org.snmp4j.smisyntaxes to refer to a classpath properties
 *  resource (relative to class org.snmp4j.smi.AbstractVariable) that overrides
 *  the default mapping for BER type 64 (nominally IpAddress).  See the file
 *  opennms-snmp4j-smisyntaxes.properties.
 *  
 *  The workaround for 8-bit long IP addresses will be enabled only if the
 *  system property org.opennms.netmgt.snmp.workarounds.allow64BitIpAddress is
 *  set to "true".
